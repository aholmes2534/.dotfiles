This is my repository for configuration files required for Archlinux, Bash, Vim, Sway WM,
Waybar, Swaylock, Wofi and various other applications. 

## Archlinux

The Arch Linux distribution is the foundation the system. The installation guide 
for my system will be here as well. This is a Thinkpad t470 uefi, systemd-boot with 
full disk encryption. LVM for the partitioning with seperate root, home, var, data 
and swap partitions on a 1T ssd.

Changing destop theme is easy just define wallpaper image in sway/conf file then change the background color in the waybar/color.css file
to your desired matching color.

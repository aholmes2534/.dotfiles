# Dotfiles for Swaywm and Archlinux

This is the repository for configuration files required for Archlinux, Bash, Vim, Sway window manager,
Waybar, Swaylock, Wofi and various other applications. 

## Why Wayland and Sway

I had settled on Mate for my Desktop Enviroment but I wasn't completely satisfied with it because resizing windows was a pain
and the user interface had become quite dated. I tried the other main DE's only to reject them for various reasons.
I decided to look into Wayland even though the conventional wisdom was that it was permanently unready. 
That lead me to Sway and now I have removed all those Xorg packages and have xwayland only for a few leftovers.
